# Legendary Edition SDK Generator

This is a slightly modified copy of TheFeckless' UE3 SDK Generator (found at UC), adapted for use with Mass Effect Legendary Edition.
The modifications include:

  - Strictly 64-bit target architecture.
  - Change of FName lookup system to work with BioWare's in-house optimization.
  - Support for multiple translation units.
